# FGA-ML-capstone-project

This is a reporsitory that collected my capstone project for Fresh Graduate Academy (FGA) Machine Learning program. FGA program is the seven-weeks training from Digital Talent Scholarship Kemenkominfo to prepare the knowledge and skill for digital talent. Capstone project submission is a mandatory for finishing that program. 

There are three project that I submit for that program, which are:
1. Email Text Classification by Natural Language Processing <br>
   Result: 95.5% accuracy for data training and 93.9% accuracy for data validation.
2. Forecasting Temperature by Data Time Series <br>
   Result: smallest mean abosulute error = 1.79 (error percentage = 5.5%)
3. Image classification with transfer learning on ResNet152V2 model dan CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) layer <br>
   Result: 93,5% accuracy for data training and 92,7% accuracy for data validation.
